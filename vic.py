# usage: vic_test.py [-h] [-p P] [--skip-hash-check] paths [paths ...]
#
# Check all video files in a folder or set of folders for errors using ffmpeg and stores results in a sqlite3
# database file.
#
# Positional arguments:
#  paths              Path(s) to video files to be validated
#
# Optional arguments:
#  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
#  -p P               Number of worker processes to spawn (default: 1)
#  --skip-hash-check  Skip hash check, assume all hashes match
#
# Details:
# Uses ffmpeg to check a set of video files for encoding errors. The results are stored in a sqlite3 database in the
# script directory. Video files are hashed with SHA1 so the ffmpeg check can be skipped if a hash match is found. If a
# non-matching hash is found for a video file in the database (i.e., file content changed but file name is the same),
# old DB row will be removed and replaced with updated hash and ffmpeg results. The database is also checked for
# non-existent files before the ffmpeg checks start. The database stores the full path of the video file, the
# SHA1 digest, a boolean value indicating if the ffmpeg test passed, and the output of the ffmpeg run (which will be
# empty if the run passed, otherwise it will contain the error output).
#
# vic.py is uses concurrent.futures to implement multi-CPU support. ffmpeg is multi-threaded, so one subprocess can
# kick of multiple threads and occupy a lot of CPU time (especially with high-resolution video files).
#
# The ffmpeg call uses the following syntax:
#
# 	ffmpeg -v error -i <video> -max_muxing_queue_size 4096 -f null -
#
# This "converts" the video using a null format and dumps the output to /dev/null. The max_muxing_queue_size is set to
# 4096 to support larger video files (4K+), otherwise ffmpeg will error out because the frame buffer won't be able to
# keep up.
